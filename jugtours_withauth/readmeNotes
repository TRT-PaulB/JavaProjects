Get lombok working on a MAC:
https://nawaman.net/blog/2017-11-05
Needs a 2nd lombok.jar registered on eclipse in MAC.....and set on in java compiler,
and add to eclipse.ini.......restart eclipse

Test in URL and POSTMAN:
http://localhost:8080/api/groups

============================================================
TO RUN: 

JavaWorkspace1.jugtours     ==> ./mvnw spring-boot:run
JavaWorkspace1.jugtours.app ==> npm start
http://localhost:3000

============================================================

Create a new REACT project (called app) in the jugtours (webservice) directory
- npm init react-app app
- cd app
- npm i bootstrap@4.1.3 react-cookie@3.0.4 react-router-dom@4.3.1 reactstrap@6.5.0
- npm update
- npm install

--> bootstrap and reactstrap are themes libraries to enhance the UI
    (https://reactstrap.github.io)

--> To proxy from /api to http://localhost:8080/api, add a proxy setting to app/package.json.

--> note that I had to disable check that webpack was braking......in a new file .env in react app directory

Access client (with webservice and react running):
http://localhost:3000

see pom for spring security additions
